<p> This home page is to tell you what this page is doing (probably nothing) and what I have learned (also probably nothing). So, I have learned many different things in this class from giving Mr.Platt specific instructions on how to make a sandwich, to making a background color vomit green (don't worry I won't use it). </p>
