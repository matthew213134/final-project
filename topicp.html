<p> The topic I'm talking about is how many injuries professional athletes (career) cause themselves. Injuries plague professional sports to this day. One injury specifically in football has led to many careers ending: a concussion. It's crazy to think that how far we've come scientifically that we haven't found anything to prevent concussions completely. </p>
